# catalog-of-things

A console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but you will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.

# Catalog of Things

In this project, we are creating a console app that will keep a record of different types of things : books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram that was provided as requirements for the project. The data will be stored in JSON files but  will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to the program's class structure.

"Catalog of my things" will be a simple console app that allows users to manage collections of the things they own.
